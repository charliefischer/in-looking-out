		        Jack is an architecture student based in Manchester.

		      <p>
		        "Currently I am studying architecture, in my final year of masters. I have always loved
		        painting from the days of art back in high school, and would try to find commissions as and
		        when I could. This will be the first painting I have done in about a year, and is actually
		        of the first picture I uploaded on Instagram 8 years ago. My art style has derived from
		        studying artists like Edward Hopper, where there is a focus on lighting to create
		        atmosphere. So when I stumbled across this old photo, I thought it was perfect for meeting
		        the brief and captures how we are feeling in these times of quarantine. As a dog lover,
		        during my art studies I was interested in the humanistic qualities of ‘man’s best friend’
		        and their relationships with us. Dogs represent our playful and free nature, and in this
		        piece are reflection of our wanting to be enjoying the outside. Being unable to source a
		        canvas in these times, this is painted on a stretched pillow case."
