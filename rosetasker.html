		        "I usually like to work with images from places I go to explore, of architecture and spots
		        in cities etc but being restricted to indoors has meant an adjustment to playing around with
		        interiors instead. The extra time has also allowed me to explore the archives of old photos
		        of the house my parents have lived in for 27 years and regenerate these, mix them with
		        imagery from now and make a 2D scenario for a jazzy new set up! It's been enjoyable to
		        re-imagine. I have to keep reminding myself how lucky I am, and that despite being a deeply
		        sad time, while we are safe and well, it is a valuable time for us to look inwards and feel
		        grateful for our homes, our family and our friends."
