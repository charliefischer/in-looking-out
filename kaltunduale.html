		        "Read is a piece a wrote long ago for Refugee week but never really shared. It’s relevance today is so clear. With the lockdown, income inequality is more evident and studying from home is very difficult to some. Whether it be a lack of resources, space or support from someone at home. It’s great schools and teachers put resources in place but it’s about accessing them. The worry is when restrictions are lifted, home-schooling will be so different between children and many may struggle for years to come. I felt worried writing this post but also an element of gratitude for those who are able to access education more freely to take advantage of the time they have to let their ambitions and minds grow."
