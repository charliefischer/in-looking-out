		        "It’s based on what probably many of us are feeling at the moment. While it’s nice to be at home away from work and have more free time, some of us maybe feeling claustrophobic or uncertainty. The future is all very unknown but we must remain hopeful. Social distancing and lockdown is probably causing mental health problems for some people, and loss of work for others. Apart from missing family and friends and getting slight cabin fever, I’m really enjoying it. I’m trying new things and spending time with loved ones. I’ve had lots of time to think about my future which is good. And I’ve had so much time to develop my illustration style. I live in a small community and I think that lockdown has actually brought us together, we’re putting on weekly street quizzes and bingo!"
